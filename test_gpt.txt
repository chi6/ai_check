 I believe that phones should be allowed in school during designated free time, but only when students are in class and have completed their assignments. This way, students can use their phones to listen to music or engage in other activities during this time. However, when students are working on assignments or taking tests, they should be allowed to use their phones to access resources or take notes.

It is important to note that if students are caught using their phones during class time or when they are supposed to be working on an assignment, they should not be punished by having their phones taken away. Instead, they should simply be reminded to put their phones away.

Furthermore, if students continue to ignore the rules and use their phones during class time or while working on assignments, it is not a solution to simply abandon them. Instead, the school should take a more proactive approach and educate students on the importance of following rules and respecting their classmates.

In conclusion, I believe that phones should be allowed in school during designated free time, but only when students are in class and have completed their assignments. When students are working on assignments or taking tests, they should be allowed to use their phones to access resources or take notes. If students are caught using their phones during class time or while working on assignments, they should simply be reminded to put their phones away.
